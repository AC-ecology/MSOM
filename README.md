Simulation and model fitting code to accompany "Fitting co-occurrence models to ecologically realistic datasets"

Case study data at https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_for_Curveira-Santos_et_al_Context-dependency_of_carnivore_co-occurrence_across_a_multi-use_conservation_landscape_/16965340/1

R Script(s) descrption:
 - Co-occurrence simulation.R: simulation code for scenarios (8 scenarios). 

 - MSOM_SimFun.R: Code for the smulation and fit of data and models (MSOM_SimandFit.fun) as well as a function to derivate general parameters from natural parameters (psi.fun)
