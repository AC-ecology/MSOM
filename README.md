# MSOM
Simulation and model fitting code to accompany "Sample size considerations for MSOM" 

R Script(s) descrption:

 - Co-occurrence simulation_v2.R: Code to simulate and fit data for the different scenarios increasing in model complexity
 - MSOM_SimFun.R: Code for the smulation and fit of data and models ('MSOM_simfit.fun.v2') as well as a function to derivate general parameters from natural parameters (psi.fun). Previous function to simulate and fit data 'MSOM_SimandFit.fun' in code too. 

 - Co-occurrence simulation.R: Old version to simulate code for scenarios (8 scenarios) using the MSOM_SimandFit.fun function. (_Deprecated from 30 Apr 2024 onwards_)
